# Particle Simulation Test Project
This is particle simulation project that I've made for educational purposes.

The task was to compare single thread, OpenMP and CUDA efficency for parallel computation.
Simulation also has simple visualisation using OpenGL.

# Dependencies
* [CUDA 10](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
* [GLM 0.9.9.3](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
* [GLFW 3.2.1](https://www.glfw.org/)

# Installation
This project wast tested and compiled in Visual Studio 2017.

Download all dependencies and update additional include and linker paths in the solution.

# Usage
* For control use keys 1, 2, 3 to switch between single thread, OpenMP and CUDA.
* Use R button to reset simulation.
